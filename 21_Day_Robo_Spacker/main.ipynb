    "This Python script utilizes the `pyttsx3` library to create a simple text-to-speech program. Let's break down the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing `pyttsx3`:**\n",
    "    - The script imports the `pyttsx3` library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - The script initializes the text-to-speech engine using `pyttsx3.init()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Welcome Message:**\n",
    "    - Prints a welcome message: \"Welcome to Robo_speaker.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text-to-Speech Loop:**\n",
    "    - Enters a `while True` loop to continuously accept user input for text-to-speech conversion.\n",
    "    - Inside the loop:\n",
    "        - Prompts the user to input the text they want the program to speak.\n",
    "        - If the user enters 'q', the program says \"Bye bye, friend!\" using the text-to-speech engine, runs it, and then breaks out of the loop, ending the program.\n",
    "        - Otherwise, the entered text is printed and then spoken by the text-to-speech engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**\n",
    "    - Uses the `engine.say(text)` method to convert the input text into speech.\n",
    "    - The `engine.runAndWait()` method is called to ensure that the speech is played immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Note on Looping:**\n",
    "    - The script uses an infinite loop (`while True`) to keep the program running until the user decides to exit by entering 'q'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Ensure you have the `pyttsx3` library installed (`pip install pyttsx3`) before running this script. Additionally, make sure that your system has a working audio output, as the script relies on the system's ability to play the generated speech."

    "   - Uses the `os.system(\"say 'text'\")` command to convert the input text into speech.\n",
    "   - The `say` command is a macOS command-line utility that converts text to audible speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This script should work on macOS since it relies on the built-in `say` command. Ensure that you are running the script on a macOS system and that the system's sound is properly configured. Additionally, be cautious when using `os.system` with user input to avoid security vulnerabilities like shell injection. Consider validating or sanitizing user input if the script is to be used in a more secure context."
