## Basic Syntax and Variables
1. Write a program that takes user's name and age as input and prints a greeting message with their age in 5 years.
2. Create variables of different data types (int, float, string, boolean) and demonstrate type conversion between them.

## Operators
3. Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using arithmetic operators.
4. Create a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

## Conditional Statements
5. Create a program that determines if a year is a leap year or not.
   - A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4
   - But if it's divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400

## Loops
6. Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms using a while loop.
7. Create a program that prints a multiplication table for a given number using a for loop.

## Functions
8. Write a function that checks if a number is prime or not.
9. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second largest number in the list.

## Data Structures
10. Write a program that:
    - Creates a list of student dictionaries with name and scores
    - Finds the student with the highest score
    - Calculates the average score of all students
    
Example structure:
```python
students = [
    {"name": "John", "score": 85},
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 92},
    {"name": "Bob", "score": 78}
]
```
