It seems like you're trying to use a module named `gofile` in Python to interact with the GoFile API for uploading and downloading files. However, I can't directly execute Python code that interacts with external modules or APIs in this environment.

If you have any questions about using the `gofile` module or need assistance with specific functionalities, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!
